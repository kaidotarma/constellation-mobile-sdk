# Pega Constellation Mobile SDK

## Overview

The **Pega Constellation Mobile SDK** is designated for Native Android and iOS applications.
It allows to embed Pega form into existing application with the possibility of using customized UI.

## Contributing and Spec-Driven Development

Feature work and significant behavior changes follow a specification-first workflow. Start with the repository guidance in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), the [project constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md), and the [.specify guide](.specify/README.md). GitHub Copilot users can use the installed Spec-Kit skills in [.github/skills](.github/skills) to create a specification, resolve open questions, plan the implementation, break it into tasks, implement the approved scope, and converge or review the result.

Specifications are stored under `specs/<feature>/`. This process is documentation-only scaffolding and does not add GitHub Actions workflows.

## Build requirements

- Gradle `9.4.0` via the checked-in Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew`)
- JDK 17 or newer to run Gradle
- Android SDK and Android Studio-compatible tooling for Android builds
- Xcode and macOS for iOS frameworks and iOS sample tests

Use the Gradle Wrapper for all project commands. The SDK currently keeps AGP `8.13.2` and Kotlin `2.4.0` unchanged while using Gradle `9.4.0`.

Currently Pega 24 and Pega 25 are supported.

The SDK allows developers to:
- register their implementations for custom components
- provide implementations for Pega components not yet available in the SDK
- register overrides for existing components

It utilizes Constellation JavaScript library and JavaScript components logic.
By default the SDK uses hidden WebView as the JavaScript execution engine.



## Supported Pega use-case

Currently, the SDK supports creating cases of a specified type, opening and processing assignments.

## Supported components
The SDK provides following components out-of-the-box:
- **Simple fields**: 
  - Checkbox, Currency, Date, DateTime, Decimal, Dropdown, Autocomplete, Email, Integer, Phone, RadioButtons, TextArea, Richtext (readonly), TextInput, Time, Url
- **Advanced fields**:
  - EmbeddedData
  - DataReference
    - Single record
      - Displayed as "SimpleTable", "Table", "Dropdown", "Autocomplete", "Cards" - supported
      - Displayed as "Search and select"
      - Read-Only mode
        - Display as "Read-only field" - supported
    - List of records
      - Displayed as "SimpleTable", "Table", "Combo-box", "Checkbox Group", "Cards" - supported
      - Displayed as "Search and select"
      - Read-Only mode
        - Displayed as "Read-only field", "Table", "SimpleTable", "Cards" - supported
        - Displayed as "Map"
    - Many to many - not supported
  - Details template view
- **Containers**: 
  - Assignment, AssignmentCard, DefaultForm, FlowContainer, Region, RootContainer, View, ViewContainer, Field Group

## Architecture

The SDK is implemented using Kotlin Multiplatform technology. It allows to share common code between multiple platforms.

The SDK consists of several modules:
- **core**: Contains core SDK logic, configuration and component abstractions. It is platform-independent and shared between all supported platforms.
- **engine**: Contains platform-specific engine implementations, which use Constellation CoreJS library that orchestrates the application logic.
- **samples**: Contains sample applications for Android and iOS platforms.
- **ui**: Contains UI components for supported UI technologies.

The SDK supports following UI technologies:
- **Android**: Compose Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose, XML/Views (*)
- **iOS**: Compose Multiplatform, SwiftUI, UIKit (*)

*\* SDK does not provide out-of-the-box components for these UI technologies*
